# bamazon-mysql-clapp

There are two apps included in this project: 
1. bamazonCustomer.js: This app lets you choose and item and designate a quantity to purchase then updates the database based on the options you chose.
2. bamazonManager.js: This app lets you view all your stock, items with less than five in stock, add stocks and add new items all together.

I have also included MySQL scripts so that you can replicate my tables if you want to try it on your own. 

Note: You will have to provide your own database password.

Here are some examples of each application working:
